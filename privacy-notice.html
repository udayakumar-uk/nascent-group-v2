        <p>We may share your personal data with third parties who are primarily business partners, Banks
          and other parties involved in the business relationship. In addition, we are sometimes required to
          share data with other entities to comply with a law or regulation. This could include regulatory
          authorities, courts, external auditors.</p>
        <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal information and to treat it in
          accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal
          information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information
          for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
        <p>We share your personal information within the Nascent Group and within the group of entities
          sharing common ownership under Nascent Group Limited. This may involve transferring your
          information outside of Bermuda.</p>
        <p>Whenever we transfer your personal information out of Bermuda, we take steps (either through
          contractual or operational means) to ensure your information receives the same or a better level
          of protection we deploy to maintain the security and confidentiality of your personal information.</p>
        <h4>How long will the personal information be retained?</h4>
        <p>We only retain data for as long as necessary to process your data. Our retention policy varies
          depending on the categories of information we collect and according to applicable law. Due to
          the nature of our business generally, we hold information for five years, but this could be longer
          depending on our obligations to you or whether we have an ongoing legal dispute with you.</p>
        <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your information: please contact the Data
          Privacy Officer for further information on your rights regarding information erasure.</p>
        <h4>Information Security</h4>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from
          being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In
          addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees.</p>
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will
          notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        <h4>Your Legal Rights</h4>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under Bermuda’s privacy laws in relation to your
          personal information. These rights are as follows, with further detail provided in the Glossary
          below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
            <li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information for the purposes of advertising, marketing, or public relations, or where the use of the personal information is causing or is likely to cause substantial damage or distress to the individual or another individual.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact the Data Privacy Officer by
          email at <a href="mailto:bror@nascentgroup.co" class="text-primary">bror@nascentgroup.co</a>.</p>
        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and
            ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights).
            This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who
            has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation
            to your request to assist our response.</p>
          <h4>Time Limit to Respond</h4>
          <p>We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within 45 days. Occasionally it may take us
            longer if your request is particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case, we
            will notify you that we will extend the response time by up to an additional 30 days, and keep
            you updated.</p>
            <h4>Changes to the Privacy Notice and your duty to inform us of changes</h4>
          <p>Nascent reserves the right to make changes to this privacy notice without noticing you. Any
            changes made will become effective when the revised notice is published on Nascent website.</p>
            <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please
              keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us.</p>
